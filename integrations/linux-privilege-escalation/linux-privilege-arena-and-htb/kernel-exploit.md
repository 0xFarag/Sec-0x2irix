## **What’s DIRTY COW ?**

This code is an **exploit** that uses a famous Linux vulnerability called **Dirty COW** (COW means "Copy-On-Write"). The idea is that it lets a normal user (non-root) **write to files** that should be **read-only**, like `/etc/passwd`.

which use exploit build on **pokemon exploit** and It saves a backup of the original `/etc/passwd` file at `/tmp/passwd.bak`—just in case. then add a user with **UID 0 Root privilege**
