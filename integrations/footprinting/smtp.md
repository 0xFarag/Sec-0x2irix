# SMTP

**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)** is the standard protocol used for **sending emails over the internet**. It operates between **email clients (such as Outlook or Gmail) and mail servers, or between different mail servers** to route messages across domains.

#### **How SMTP Works?**

1. **Establishing Connection:**
   * The email client connects to the **SMTP server** via a specific **port (25, 587, or 465)**.
2. **Authentication:**
   * Some SMTP servers require **username and password authentication** to ensure the sender is authorized

#### **What is ESMTP?**

ðŸ”¹ **Extended SMTP (ESMTP)** is an enhanced version of SMTP, commonly `used today.`

ðŸ”¹ It supports **TLS encryption** via **STARTTLS**, which upgrades the connection to a secure SSL/TLS channel.

***

To interact with an SMTP server, use the telnet tool to establish a TCP connection on port 25 (e.g., `telnet 10.129.14.128 25`). Once connected, initiate the session with the **HELO** or **EHLO** command (e.g., `EHLO [example.com](<http://example.com/>)`) to identify yourself to the server. This allows you to manually test the SMTP server, send emails, or check for vulnerabilities. The server will respond with a confirmation and available features if the session is successfully started.

The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system

```bash
htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 

VRFY root
```

***

#### **Footprinting**

```bash
nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25
```

**Nmap - Open Relay**

```bash
nmap 10.129.14.128 -p25 --script smtp-open-relay -v
```

open relay which use to send email to any user

```bash
telnet 10.129.14.128 25
EHLO example.com
MAIL FROM:<fake@nowhere.com>
RCPT TO:<real@somewhere.com>
DATA
Subject: Test Email
This is a test.
.
QUIT
```

now you can brute force on username

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
set RHOSTS <Target-IP>
run
```

```bash
smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U users.txt -t <Target-IP>
```
