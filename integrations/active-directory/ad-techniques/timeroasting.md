# Timeroasting

A technique that abuses the Microsoft SNTP/Windows Time service: when a client requests time, the DC responds with a blob signed/HMACâ€™d using a machine account key. That blob can be captured and cracked offline to recover the machine account password (or key material). Not the same as standard NTLM/AS-REP, but same offline-crack idea.
